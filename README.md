# amazon_clone_project

This project is a work in progress and is not yet complete. The things I still have to implement in this project are as follows:
- Deploy to firebase
- implement payment

This is a clone of Amazon that I created as a passion project to show my knowledge of React, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. This app has user authentication, the ability to add/delete items to a cart, and will have a way to actually pay for the items (not really, but has the code necessary to take payment if this were an actual online shop).

To run this locally on your machine, please do the following:
- `git clone` the repo and open it in your preferred IDE
- type `npm install` in the terminal, then `npm start` to spin it up locally.
